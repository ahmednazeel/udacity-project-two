 // Weather-Journal App Project //

  This is my second project, and I hope to be successful in using the tools that I learned to implement what is required of me in this project.

 
 // Overview // 

* You have created an asynchronous web application that uses the web API and user data to dynamically update the user interface.
* I used ES6 when writing the code.
* I changed some HTML and CSS to make the app simple
* I added a small flag to display the error message that is coming from the API.
* I used an extension on the URL (& unit = metric) to get the Celsius temperature.
* I wrote comments to make the code easier to read.

 // How to use // 

* All you should do is write the ZIP code of the city (United States).
* The application will show you.
  - the name of the city. 
  - the temperature.
  - the date.
  - description of weather.
  - your feelings.
